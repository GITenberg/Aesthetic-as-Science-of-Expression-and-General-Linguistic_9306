description: Historical intellectualism has been the cause of the many researches
  which have been made, especially during the last two centuries, researches which
  continue to-day, for a philosophy of history, for an ideal history, for a sociology,
  for a historical psychology, or however may be otherwise entitled or described a
  science whose object is to extract from history, universal laws and concepts. Of
  what kind must be these laws, these universals? Historical laws and historical concepts?
  In that case, an elementary criticism of knowledge suffices to make clear the absurdity
  of the attempt.
